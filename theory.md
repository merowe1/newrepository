    Staged Changes: Before committing, you must stage the changes you want to include in the commit using git add. This allows you to selectively choose the files or modifications to be part of the commit.

    Commit Message: A descriptive commit message is necessary to explain the purpose or nature of the changes. Using the -m flag followed by a meaningful message with git commit -m "Your message" ensures a clear understanding of the commit's intent.
